# Lagrange's Theorem

For any finitite group $G$ and subgroup $H\subseteq G: |H|$ divides $|G|$

**Corollary**:
For any prime $p$ and $g \in Z^{*}_{p}$ the order of $g$ must divide $\phi(p)=p-1$

**Fact**:
For any prime $p$ there are $\phi(\phi(p))$ many elements $g \in Z^{*}_{p}$ that have maximal order $\phi(p)=p-1$

> $\phi(x)$ is [[Euler's Totient function]]
