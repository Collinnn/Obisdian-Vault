# Euler's Theorem
>[!info] Definition
> 
> For positive integer $N$ define $Z^{*}_{N} = \{x \in Z_{N}\} |gcd(x,N)=1$
> [[Euler's Totient function]]: $|Z_{N}^{*}| = \varphi(N)$
> 
> Then for all: $x \in Z_{N}^{*}:$
> $x^{\varphi(N)}=1 \text{ mod } N$
> 
> Remember:
> - $Z_{N}$ is the set of remainders
> - $Z^{*}_{N}$ is the [[Greatest Common Divisor#Properties |Â coprime]] remainders. 


When $N$ is prime, this is called **Fermat's little theorem**
