## Discrete logarithms modulo a prime

Let $p$ be a prime

**Regular logarithm** 
$2^{a}=1024$, solve for $a$, super easy

**Discrete logarithm**
$g^{a}=h \text{ mod }p$, solve for a, **REALLY HARD**

> Answer is: $a=9$


### Hardness of DLOG
- When is DLOG difficult?
	1. $p$ is large prime (brute force attacks)
	2. $p-1$ must have at least one large prime factor
	3. $q$ must be large (brute force attacks)
